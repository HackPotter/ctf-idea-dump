# Description

Basic Caesar Shift ciphers are easy to break using a technique called frequency analysis. The improved cipher earned the name ‘le chiffre indéchiffrable’ (the indecipherable cipher) after surviving three centuries of cracking attempts.
You’ll need a key to decode this one. It wouldn’t be quite as fun if I just gave you that key, so how about some trivia? Who is considered by many to be the father of modern computer science? Just his last name will be sufficient.
