# Disclaimer

There are going to be several flags on here that may pop up in a future CDC or CTF. Please, please do not share the solutions if you figure them out or find them. While you will still have to do the work of solving, the flags are here and the description to solve is here as well.

Please keep the spirit of a competitive CTF alive and keep answers to yourself

## CTF Flag Dump

This is a repo to dump CTF flag / CDC anom ideas. This was created because loading up a single CDC with 30 flags proved to be a bad idea, so I wanted to keep them somewhere I would remember them and could be used in the future.

You will have to forgive the file structure, as it isn't the most human readable, but this is Nate readable and helps my brain stay at least a little organized

## Contributing

I'm more than happy to accept PRs, I totally want to see what people can come up with for flags. CTFs are super enjoyable and creating enough flags proves to be a challenge, so why not have a massive vault?

### The Structure: Where the things go

At the top level, a folder which is the name of the anom. Under it, a README as well as the description.md, solution.md, and optionally any file folders if files are required. The README should contain a brief description of the challenge. The solution may be posted in there, but is not required, as a full solution will be put in the solution.md file

The description.md file is what will be shown to the competitors, so it should contain any hints or words about the anom you choose. This can be cryptic and unhelpful, or you can provide a hint as to how to solve the flag, in true CTF fashion. The solution.md file will be only seen by the staff/hosts of the event. This should contain any information required to solve the flag, a thorough writeup as to the solution, as well as the flag itself.

### What defines a completed flag

For the purposes of this repo, if an anom/flag is incomplete, it should be in the WIP folder. Completeness is defined as

1) Including all necessary parts of the anom, including, a description, solution, and any files incolved
2) Having been solved correctly and a complete writeup in the solution file explaining the steps to complete the flag as well as the flag itself

If either of these conditions are not met, it is considered to be incomplete and should be in the WIP folder
