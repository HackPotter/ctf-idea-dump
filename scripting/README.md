# Scripting Anoms

This is a dump for scripting-based anoms. However, this can be a little subjective. For my purposes, these are anoms that I would personally solve through scripting, or I think would be most easily solved with scripts. That being said, they can be solved any way possble, as there are many solutions in a CTF.
